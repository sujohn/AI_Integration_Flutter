AI tools Integration in Flutter app

# Frameworks & Tools
 - **ChatGPT:** API based ChatGPT model use.
 - **Gemini:** Use of the Firebase SDK for Generative AI for advanced text generation, summarization, and chat features.
 - **TensorFlow Lite:** For running machine learning models directly on the device (on-device AI) for speed, privacy, and offline functionality, handling image, text, and sound analysis.
 - **ML Kit / Camera Plugin:** Powers computer vision tasks like face, object, and text detection within images, leveraging the device camera via packages like the official camera plugin.
 - **Google Assistant/Platform Channels:** Enables voice commands and hands-free app interaction through custom platform-specific code using MethodChannels for integration with Google Assistant or Siri.
 - **Flutter Native ML:** A plugin that gives direct access to native device machine learning accelerators like the Apple Neural Engine and Android NNAPI for high performance.
Integration Methods

# Integration Methods
 - **On-Device AI:** Use TensorFlow Lite or Flutter Native ML for fast, offline functionality and enhanced privacy.
 - **Cloud-Based AI (APIs):** Connect to external services like OpenAI, Google Gemini, or Llama via web APIs or the Firebase SDK for complex tasks (e.g., advanced chatbots).
 - **Hybrid Approach:** Combine on-device processing for speed with cloud models via Firebase ML for advanced capabilities.

# AI Features
 - **Personalization:** Tailoring content and experiences to individual users.
 - **Chatbots & Virtual Assistants:** Conversational AI for user support and interaction.
 - **Image/Object Recognition:** Identifying objects, faces, or text in photos.
 - **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understanding and generating human language for features like predictive text.
